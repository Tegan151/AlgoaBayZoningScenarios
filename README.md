# Script 1. Examples of getting data ready for prioritizR
This script provides examples of how to:
  - prepare spatial data in the R environment for RioritizR with zones
  - extrapolate intensity data of fishing within a MPA to areas outside of the MPA
  - create cost layers for zones
  - create a layer of 'locked in' planning units
  - calculate area based targets as described by Holness et al. 2022 (doi: 10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109574)
  - create and save inputs for prioritizR with zones
# Script 2. Example of calibrating boundary penalty
- This code provides an example of how the manuscript identified the optimal boundary penalty for the zoning scenarios 

# Script 3. Final prioritizations
- This code provides the final code to run zoning scenarios prioiritizations and mapping presented in the manuscript 

# All data necessary to run these scripts can be found in data folder




These script do not explain prioritizR's inner workings and functions. For more detail about prioritizR, please visit the developer's website: https://prioritizr.net/
